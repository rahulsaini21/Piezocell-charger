# Piezocell-charger

In this project our team developed a piezoelectric charger.

Step1: Firstly we studied about piezocells in depth and then after testing and scaling we were able to power LED.

Step2: Next we tried different layout to arrange piezocells to gain maximum output and make our structure stronger.

came up with following layout

Step3: then we performed simulation and inculded safety measure for structure stability.

Step4: then we selected material and began fabrication. We repeatedly changed our design to fulfill requiments.
