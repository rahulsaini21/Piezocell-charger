# Piezocell-charger

In this project our team developed a piezoelectric charger.

Firstly we studied about piezocells in depth and then after testing and scaling we were able to power LED.

Next we tried different layout to arrange piezocells to gain maximum output and make our structure stronger.

then we performed simulation and inculded safety measure for structure stability.

then we selected material and began fabrication. We repeatedly changed our design to fulfill requiments.
